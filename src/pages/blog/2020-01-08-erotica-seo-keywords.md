So I noticed that the guide for [writing erotica](https://lessonsinsmut.tumblr.com/12) on Kindle was rather out of date (it was from 2015, after all), and since I know a little bit about SEO, I decided to spend several evenings gathering data with a very slow, free service to find the New Big Keywords for Erotica. In case you don't know, SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. So, basically this is what the customers who will read and purchase your content will most likely be searching for when the go looking for erotica on Amazon.

I imagine there are lots more niches that I didn’t catch with my search, but these are likely the most popular ones since they came up quite quickly. The most important thing, is that people *find* your amazing erotica, and I want to help you reach them a lot easier.

**Most Popular Type of Search**: (Types of Searches 2+)

1. Taboo
2. Daddy
3. Lesbian
4. Gay
5. Romance
6. Menage
7. Alpha Male
8. Historical
9. Harem
10. Rough
11. Doctor
12. Virgin
13. Step-Daughter
14. Step-Dad

**Less Popular, Still Frequently Searched**: (Types of Searches 1)

15. Paranormal
16. Reverse Harem
17. Step-Brother
18. Teacher/Student
19. Family
20. Asian
21. Age Play
22. Swingers
23. Horror
24. Hypnosis
25. Older Man
26. Milking
27. Wife
28. Mom/Son (*these two were specifically searched together*)
29. Medical
30. Forced
31. Fairy Tale
32. Fantasy
33. Captured
34. Cheating
35. Pregnancy
36. Group sex
37. Spanking
38. Domestic
39. Discipline
40. Babysitter
41. Sci-Fi
42. Maids
43. Mafia
44. Western
45. Regency
46. Brat

While the old list is certainly out of date, I do think most of their Golden Twelve of Erotica survived through the years. You can definitely still find Alpha Males in the [Top 100](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Kindle-Store-Erotica/zgbs/digital-text/157057011), as well as several others. But Cowboys is definitely out. It’s Doctors’ time to shine! I definitely recommend glancing over the other categories of top 100 for erotica as well, because they've also got some kinks that the keyword search definitely didn't pick up, like Monsters and Shifters, even though those categories definitely seem to still be popular.

Another thing I learned from all my research is to try and include as many of your keywords in your description, so even if you weren’t able to tag all of it, you’ll still be able to show up in the search! I hadn’t particularly heard this anywhere other than blog posts done by authors writing non-erotica publications like [here](https://www.tckpublishing.com/using-seo-to-sell-more-books-on-amazon/), which isn’t something I tend to really look at since a lot of the time, the tips don’t really apply to erotica publishing. It's definitely something worth looking into though, if you don't know a lot about SEO.

In addition to all of that, I discovered some other fun information that might interest someone. The amount of times that books, short stories, and the like are included in searches:

![SEO Amazon Book Searches](/img/seo-amazon-books.png "Types of Amazon Erotica Searches by Book/Short Stories/etc.")

Books is clearly the most popular, but potentially including information like that yours is a short story, might grab you more potential buyers when the system goes looking for you.

Additionally, there are tons of erotica stories that are bundled, made into an anthology, and whatnot, and here are the buzzwords for that as well:

![SEO Amazon Book Series Searches](/img/seo-amazon-book-collections.png "Types of Erotica Collection Searches")

From what I can tell, naming your anthology a collection or a series might gather more readers since that’s looked for more frequently than anything else. Hopefully this information is helpful! I certainly tried to make it be. Thanks for giving it a read!

This information was collected by searching *erotica*, *erotic*, and *sex stories* over multiple keyword searches and then consolidating the information. This was done with the free service, [Scientific Seller](https://app.scientificseller.com/#/).
