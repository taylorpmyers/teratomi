  My erotica novel was blocked by Amazon KDP. I've been publishing on the
  platform for almost three weeks now, and got my first blocked book! I was
  planning on it being as part of a series with my other recent novel, but it
  seems like this one won't be included now.

My erotica novel was [blocked](https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G200672670) by Amazon KDP. I've been publishing on the platform for almost three weeks now, and got my first blocked book! I was planning on it being as part of a series with [The Butterfly's Incubator](https://www.amazon.com/Butterflys-Incubator-Naomi-Spicer-ebook/dp/B083CTC3WX/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=butterfly+incubator+naomi+spicer&qid=1578215925&sr=8-1), but it seems like this one won't be included now. I received an email from Amazon a few hours ago (several hours after they blocked it this morning), which you can see below:

As you can see, they didn't explain why it was banned, so I'm left with only guessing what it could potentially be about, and while I have a few, I'm disappointed that I won't even get the chance to correct it and have it published later on. I assume it was because it skirted the line of bestiality with the giant spider monster. I'm a big fan of oviposition in regards to bugs or other "scary" creatures, so I imagine I just need to do a little better next time toeing the line, and it seems I'm not alone in this, several other erotica authors have run into this same issue, and while I am trying to get in contact with Amazon about it, I've seen the warnings about attempting to [republish](https://www.kboards.com/index.php?topic=194646.0) a blocked novel. 

Hopefully soon I'll get some answers from Amazon soon, but they've yet to even reestablish that one of my books belongs to me. It is still available in the kindle store, and yet I am unable to access it or receive profits from its sales. I have a lot of feelings about Amazon's bookstore, and some are positive but most are negative. Amazon pays roughly half a penny per page read on Unlimited, and since I write shorts, I'm not turning a huge profit. All I can do though is keep trucking on, and hopefully not get blocked again.

If you're interested in reading my blocked novel, it is available now on [Smashwords](https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/998641). Fortunately Smashwords has no problem with all kinds of taboo erotica, and has helped me out a lot in learning how to make my books look a lot more professional with their formatting guide. They have a whole host of erotica to read there, so if you're ever getting fed up with Amazon, definitely give Smashwords a look.
