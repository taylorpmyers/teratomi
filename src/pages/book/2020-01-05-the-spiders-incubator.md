title: The Spider's Incubator
description: >-
  Emily was in the forest to investigate a strange spider sighting. One of the
  local townspeople had said that the spider was at least the size of a small
  dog and had taken some of his livestock. Now, Emily had been on at the county
  force for a while now, and she was sure that the man was just losing his mind
  in his old age... until she finds herself caught in the mutated creatureâ€™s
  web.
