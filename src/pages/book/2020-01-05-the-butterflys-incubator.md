title: The Butterfly's Incubator
description: >-
  Casey, a young biologist studying a new species of caterpillar, finds out that
  its metamorphosis won't result in a small butterfly as expected, but a giant,
  almost humanoid one. Each beat of its magnificent, colorful wings releases a
  strange sweet scent that drives her absolutely wild.
