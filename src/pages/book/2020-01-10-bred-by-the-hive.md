title: Bred By The Hive
description: >-
  Laura had suddenly decided to pack up and move to the middle of nowhere, tired
  of her life and job and feeling like she wasn’t going anywhere regardless of
  how long she toiled away at her shiny, corporate job. Her new house in the
  boonies was described by locals as haunted by ghosts. Laura didn’t
  particularly believe all the superstitious droll and bought it anyway. Little
  did she know, the attic was home to an alien species of bees in need of a new
  queen.
